# Pokémon Sepia
This is the WIP readme for Pokémon Sepia. 

For those new to GitHub: Me too. Check out the issues tab to the right? I put a discussion there, and I think it's a good place for most of our discussions. All of us are intelligent; I'm sure we can figure this stuff out.

Also github have made a thing explaining how the workflow here works: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html<br>Hey, it actually helped me understand a bit!
