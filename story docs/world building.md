This is set in a 20's, prohibition-era like pokémon setting. Possibly Kanto? 

decoy recommended we watch Pokémon 4ever, for the couple of scenes looking at Oak's past. Also to looks at Agatha's past, unless I'm mixing up people's recommendations.

There was talk of having pokemon battles being illegal, as it's too close to gambling. And team rocket could be like moonshiners or something? Game corner illegal shenanigans!

As for geographic setting, I'd suggest Kanto, with extensions from the anime, such as orange islands, and perhaps a bit of Johto? After all, if I'm not mistaken, kid!Oak was wandering that forest in Johto. Could have some nice tie-ins.
